Left tool output in "Input" folder since that is how
the tool works.  Expected results are in the "Output"
folder.

Assigned requirements : 2+ SRCs, 2+ demand groups

These were minimum requirements.  This was the initial creation of notional 
data on NIPR.  I glanced at "test" input data on SNET and tried to capture
the more interesting records that might cause the test to fail.  

First try, this actually failed when there was no demand for Chipmunks, but
that kind of record is unlikely to be in the FORGE data, so I put a quantity
in there for people to use this test set as a template for other tests.

Resulting case includes:

3 SRCs
3 Demand groups (1 forge and 2 vignettes)
