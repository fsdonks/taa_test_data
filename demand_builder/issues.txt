Major:
FORGE demand start day needs to be specified by vignette mapping.

What should the duration of the last FORGE demand be?  Defaults to
0 duration right now.  Is this what we want it to do?

Related to last:  In the complexest_trial_n_error test, the duration
of a next to last FORGE demand is 0.  This looks wrong.


Minor:
"Created demand file" path is wrong.  Doesn't include filename before _DEMAND.txt

All blank quantities for an SRC in FORGE data will cause an error, but this type of record is unlikely to exist in the FORGE output.
